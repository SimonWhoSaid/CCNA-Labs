# Lab Exercise

In this lab you will complete a basic configuration on a switch, verify Cisco
Discovery Protocol CDP and analyse the effects of interface speed and duplex
configuration.

## Cisco Router and Switch Configuration Task

1) Configure Router 1 with the hostname ‘R1’
  - First we must go into global configuration then use the command _hostname_ in order to change the Router's name to R1
  - <img width="434" height="61" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d4e9ef0-4e23-498e-8426-3937baa12c2f" />
2) Configure Router 2 with the hostname ‘R2’
  - We will repeast the same steps with R2
3) Configure Switch 1 with the hostname ‘SW1’
  - Repeat the same steps with SW1
4) Configure the IP address on R1 according to the topology diagram
  - Now we will give the interface of F0/0 the IP address of 10.10.10.1/24 by entering the interface with command, _interface f0/0_, then after we have entered the interface config (config-if) we will use the command _ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0_. Then we always end an IP configuration with _no shutdown_ to enable the port.

5) Configure the IP address on R2 according to the topology diagram
  - Repeat the same steps with R2 with the IP address of 10.10.10.2
6) Give SW1 the management IP address 10.10.10.10/24
  - Switches are not aware of IP addresses, but you can assign a single management IP address. You can do this by configuring the Switched Virtual Interface (SVI). From global configuration we will use _interface vlan 1_ then enter the ip address like how we did for the routers
  - <img width="368" height="80" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f53b187-402c-48ef-a4d1-0aff747bf4ae" />
7) The switch should have connectivity to other IP subnets via R2
  - We will use R2 as our default gateway. In global configuration we will use the command _ip default-gateway 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0_
  - <img width="322" height="66" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da8cc93d-4dbe-4bc7-94fe-344b5e328f05" />
8) Verify the switch can ping its default gateway
  - We verify the connectivty with a _ping_ and I can see that the switch is able to ping R2
  - <img width="491" height="94" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d63e093-09df-456b-af12-5267c0498964" />
9) Enter suitable descriptions on the interfaces connecting the devices
  - Now we will create a description link to the interfaces. We will enter the interface configuration again and use _description_ then we add the description to what we afterwards.
  - <img width="434" height="53" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74bf9a37-4999-48f9-a9f9-6ac7163be1b4" />
10) On SW1, verify that speed and duplex are automatically negotiated to 100Mbps full duplex on the link to R1
  - Verify with _show interfaces status_
  - <img width="575" height="65" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5168d192-35c6-449c-905e-a10f40176445" />
11) Manually configure full duplex and FastEthernet speed on the link to R2
  - We will enter F0/2 on the switch and use the two commands _duplex full_ and _speed 100_ to set up the duplex and speed of the link. This will cause our link to shutdown because R2 also needs to be configured with the same duplex and speed settings.
  - <img width="576" height="60" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0398599-4eb9-4ae8-b45e-e65fe54ac189" />
  - Now on R2 we will also configure the same thing on the interface.
  - <img width="596" height="101" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65372ba6-207c-4f66-b946-00016a879dcf" />
  - Then we can verify with a _show ip interface brief_ on R2 and see that the connection is back up.
  - <img width="568" height="75" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d70419a0-704d-440e-9dc3-d46f18d41093" />
12) What version of IOS is the switch running?
  - To verify the IOS version we will use _show version_ in privleged exec mode. Then we will see out current verison in 12.2.
  - <img width="576" height="82" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73e7c40d-2559-4865-893a-06c3d97d9051" />


## CDP Configuration
1) Verify the directly attached Cisco neighbors using Cisco Discovery
Protocol
  - We can verify the directly attached Cisco neighbors with _show cdp neighbors_ or _show cdp neighbors detail_
  - <img width="587" height="239" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5896ee38-7e2b-4fbe-84fa-d588915ea9bc" />
2) Prevent R1 from discovering information about Switch 1 via CDP
  - We will disable CDP on the interface of R1 with no _no cdp enable_
3) Flush the CDP cache on R1 by entering the ‘no cdp run’ then ‘cdp run’
commands in global configuration mode
4) Verify that R1 cannot see SW1 via CDP
  - After completing the instructions we no longer see SW1 listed.

## Switch Troubleshooting

1) Verify the status of the switch port connected to R2 with the show ip
interface brief command. It should show status and protocol up/up.
  - <img width="574" height="62" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efc2bfad-e5bd-4cb0-9eff-87b0f49c0739" />
2) Shut down the interface connected to R2 and issue a show ip
interface brief command again. The status and protocol should
show administratively down/down.
  - Enter the interface f0/2 on the switch and enter the commands.
  - <img width="613" height="203" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23a752c-e357-4f4f-a572-2e255faddb48" />
3) Bring the interface up again. Verify the speed and duplex setting.
  - Bring the interface back up with a _no shutdown_ then use _show interfaces status_ to view the speed and duplex settings
  - <img width="573" height="67" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0b057b2-ab65-4b37-b6f5-37a8f610f257" />
4) Set the duplex to half on Switch 1. Leave the settings as they are on R2.
  - Enter the interface and use _duplex half_ to change the duplex.
5) Verify the state of the interface.
  - The state of the interface has been changed back to down.
  - <img width="611" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4281af87-479e-4027-878a-70d233f429d1" />
6) Set the duplex back to full duplex.
  - Enter the interface and change it back to full
7) Set the speed to 10 Mbps.
  - Since the speed is set back to 10 the interface will be down.
8) Check if the interface is still operational.
  - <img width="618" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e55b093-e381-4b02-92c6-04da65e2cd68" />
9) Check if the interface is operational on R2. What is the status of the
interface?
  - Status of the interface on R2 will be Up/Down because of the speed mismatch.
