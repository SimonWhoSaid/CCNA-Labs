# Lab Exercise

In this lab you will perform a factory reset, password recovery, configuration
backup, and system image backup and recovery on a Cisco router. You will also
perform an IOS upgrade on a Cisco switch.

## Factory Reset

1) View the running configuration on R1. Note that the hostname and
interface have been configured.
  - We can view the running configuration on R1 with _show running-config_. We can view the version, hostname, interfaces, and much more.

2) Factory reset R1 and reboot.
  - In order to factory reset any router or switch you can use the command _write erase_ then we will use the _reload_ command to reboot the router.

3) Watch the boot up process as the router boots.
4) The router should boot into the Setup Wizard. Exit out of the wizard and
then confirm the startup and running configurations are empty.
  - We will type 'N' for no for the setup

5) Paste the configuration for R1 from the ‘15 Cisco Device Management
Configs.zip’ file back into the configuration and save. Neil Anderson has provided this to input into the lab.

end


## Password Recovery

1) Set the enable secret ‘Flackbox1’ on R1 and save the running-
configuration.
  -
2) Configure the router to boot into the rommon prompt on next reload with
an appropriate command and reboot the router.
3) In rommon mode, configure the router to ignore the startup-config when
booting up, and reload the router.
4) The router should boot into the Setup Wizard. Exit out of the wizard.
5) What do you expect to see if you view the running and startup
configurations? Confirm this.
6) Copy the startup config to the running config. Do not miss this step or you
will factory reset the router!
7) Verify the status of interface GigabitEthernet0/0. Why is it down?
8) Bring interface GigabitEthernet0/0 up.
9) Remove the enable secret.
10) Ensure the router will reboot normally on the next reload and that you will
be able to access the router.
11) Reboot the router and confirm it has the expected configuration.

## Configuration Backup
1) Backup the running configuration to Flash on R1. Use a suitable name for
the backup file. Verify the configuration has been backed up.
  -
2) Backup the R1 startup configuration to the TFTP server. Use a suitable
name for the backup file. Verify the configuration has been backed up.

## IOS System Image Backup and Recovery
1) Backup the IOS system image on R1 to the TFTP server. Verify the
configuration has been backed up.
  -
2) Delete the system image from Flash and reload.
3) Use Internet search to find system recovery instructions for your model of
router. Recover the system image using the TFTP server.

## IOS Image Upgrade
1) Verify SW1 is running C2960 Software (C2960-LANBASE-M), Version
12.2(25)FX
  -
2) Use the TFTP server to upgrade to c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE4.bin
3) Reboot and verify the switch is running the new software version.
