We will be configuring InterVLAN Routing in this lab.

Here is our lab diagram and we want to have PC1 be able to ping PC2. Because PC1 and PC 2 are on different networks we need to configure everything so that they are able to communicate with each other.

In Cisco Packet Tracer I have created the network diagram and the first thing we need to do is configure the IP addresses of the PCs.

PC1 IP Address 10.0.0.10/24 with a Default Gateway of 10.0.0.1 and PC2 IP Address 172.16.0.10/24 with a Default Gateway of 172.16.0.1
