# OSPF

## OSPF Characteristics
- OSPF is a link state routing protocol
- It supports large networks
- It has very fast convergence time
- MEssages are sent using Multicast
- OSPF is an open standard protocol
- Uses an alogrithm to determine the best path to learned networks

## OSPF vs EIGRP vs RIP
- RIP has scalability limitations so it is not typically used in production netowrks
- Most companies use EIGRP or OSPF for their IGP
- OSPF is the most commonly used
- OSPF has lots of documentation and is an open standard
- EIGRP can be simpler to implement and troubleshoot

## Link State Routing Protocols
- In link state routing protocols, each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbours
- This information is passed unchanged from one router to another
- Every router learns the full picture of the network including every router, its interfaces and what they connect to
- OSPF routers use Link State Advertisements (LSA) to pass on routing updates

## OSPF Operations
1. Discover neighbours
2. Form Adjancies
3. Flood Link State Database (LSDB)
4. Compute Shortest Path
5. Install Best Routes in Routing Table
6. Respond to Network Changes

## OSPF Packet Types
- Hello Packets: A router will send out and listen for hello packets when OSPF is enabled on an interface, and form adjancencies with other OSPF rouers on the link
- Database Description (DBD): Then when the router forms an adjancency, adjacent routers will tell each other the networks they know about with the DBD packet
- Link State Request (LSR): If a router is missing information about any of the networks in the received DBD, it will send the neighbour an Link State Request
- Link State Advertisement (LSA): A routing update
- Link State Update (LSU): Contains a list of LSA's which should be updated, used during flooding
- LSAck: Receiving routers acknowledge LSAs

## OSPF Configuration - Process ID
- Must be in global config. _router OSPF 1_
  - The 1 represents the process ID
- Different interfaces on a router can run in different instances of OSPF
- Different instances have different LSDB
- Only one instance is typically configured on OSPF routers - multiple process IDs are very rarely used
- The process ID is locally significant. It does not have to match on the neighbour router to form an adjacency.

  - R2 will still form adjancies with R1 and R3. R1 and R3 will not learn about each other because of different Process IDs

## OSPF Configuration - Network
- Must be in global configuration. _router OSPF 1_ _network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0_
- The network command uses a wildcard mask
- The command does not default to using the classful boundary, you must enter a wildcard mask
- The network command explanation
  - Look for interfaces with an IP address which falls within this wildcard mask
  - Enable OSPF on those interfaces which means - Send out and listen for OSPF hello messages and peerf with adjacent OSPF routers
  - Advertise the network and mask which is configured on those interfaces
  - One thing to note is that wildcard does not target the subnet mask it is pointing to.
    - 0.0.0.255 Wilcard mask will not target a /24 subnet.

## OSPF Verification
_Sh Run | section OSPF_
- This will display the ospf command in the running config

_Show ip ospf interace brief_
- Interace that has OSPF, PID, Area, IP Address/Mask, Cost, State, Neighbors

_Show IP ospf neighbor_
- Shows neighbors attached to the router

_Show IP ospf database_
- Shows links in the area and ths OSPF network

_Show IP Route_
- Double check if you have OSPF routes in the routing table

# OSPF Advanced Topics

## OSPF Router ID
- OSPF Routers identify themselves using an OSPF Router ID which is in the form of an IP address
- This will default to being the highest IP address of any loopback interfaces configured on the router, or the highest other IP address if a loopback does not exist
- Loopback interfaces never go down so the Router ID will nto change
- You can also manually specify the Router ID
- Best practice is to use a loopback or manaully set the Router ID

## OSPF Rotuer ID - No Loopback
<img width="496" height="274" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4173856e-1915-47da-b2d2-319e01e113c7" />

- If there is no loopback address set, it will choose the highest IP interface on the router and use that as its Router ID.
- In the example above FE3/0 has an IP address of 10.0.3.1, so when we do a _Show Ip Protocols_ the Router ID for OSPF will be 10.0.3.1

## OSPF Router ID - With Loopback
<img width="519" height="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2a37467-293c-460d-b191-371baacd2464" />

- Since there is a loopback address enabled on the router, the router prefers to use that address as the Router ID instead of the highest IP interface

## OSPF Router ID - Manual Configuration
- In global configuration
  - _Router OSPF 1_
  - _router-id x.x.x.x_
  - end
- _clear ip ospf process_
- Show ip protocols to confirm the router id

## Passive Interface Configurations
- In global configuration
  - _Router OSPF 1_
  - _Passive-interface loopback 0_
  - _Passive-interface [interface]_
  - Then input the network command on the outgoing interface
    - _network [Interface IP] [Wildcardmask] [Area]_
   
- If more of oyur interfaces are passive, then you can set passive-interface as the default
  - _Router OSPF 1_
  - _Passive-interface default_ This sets all interfaces on the router as passive
  - From here we can set up which interfaces we don't want as passive.
  - _No passive-interface f0/0_
  - _No passive-interface f1/0_
 
Remember passive interfaces are used for advertising a routing protocol to form adjaacencies, but don't want to advertise that subnet out to the network.

## Default Route Injection
- Injecting the OSPF protocol to go out to the internet
- _ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [Internet IP Address]_
- _Router ospf 1_
- _Default-information originate_

To verify it
- _Show Ip Route_
- Double check that OSPF has a route to 0.0.0.0
- It will show as an external route for OSPF, which means it was redistributed into OSPF

# OSPF Areas
- Every router learns the full picture of the network including every router, its interfaces, and what they connect to.
- This can casue issues in large networks
  - Too many routers can use up too much router memory
  - Network changes cause all routers to reconverge which takes time and CPU resources
- OSPF supports a hierarchical design which segments large networks into smaller areas to solve this problem
- Each router maintains full information about its own area, but only summary information about other areas
  - So if a new router goes up or down in a different area it only effects that area
 
- A two level hierachy is used
  - Area 0 or Transit area
    - Does not generally contain end users
  - Regular areas
    - Regular areas are used to connect end users to the Transit area. By default, all transit traffic goes through the transit area
    - Regular areas should not be in contact with each other.
- Small networks do not require a hierarchical design and all routers can be in Area 0

<img width="839" height="341" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79bae6cf-754b-4878-a4cb-20d6aa21a45b" />


## OSPF Configuration - Network
- The area is configured at theinterface level with the _network_ command
  - In router config _network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0_
- For a router to form an adjacency, its neighbour must be configured to be in the same area, area mismatches will not form adjancies

## OSPF Router Types - Backbone Routers
- Routers which have all their OSPF interfaces in Area 0 are backbone routers
- Routers maintain a full LSDB of other routers and links in their own area

## Internal Routers
- Routers received from other routers in the same area appear as internal OSPF routers
- In the _show ip route_ command you'll be able to see all the OSPF routes in bold
- <img width="956" height="137" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7e01463-0295-4a9a-8a89-c8c26ebf4d3f" />


## OSPF Router Types - ABRs
- Area Border Routers
- Routers which have interfaces in multiple areas are ABRs
- ABRs separates LSA flooding zones
- It becomes the primary point for area address summarization. SUMMARIZATION IS ALWAYS DONE ON YOUR ABRs
- It functions regularly as the source for default routes
- It maintains the LSDB for each area with which it is connected
- The ideal design is to have each ABR connected to two areas only, the backbone and another normal area
- ABRs do not automatically summarize
- If you do not configure summarization, all routes are flooded everywhere
- Manual Summarization configuration
  - _Router OSPF 1_
  - _Network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0_
  - _Network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 1_
  - _Area 0 range 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0_
  - _Area 1 range 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0_
- In this example we have configured the network of the OSPF range and summarization of the two interfaces on the router.
<img width="1019" height="160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08a98fae-3fe9-49fb-bac6-5fe7b276b12d" />

- Inter Area Routers are routers that are learned by an ABR. They will show up in the routing table.

## OSPF Router Types - Normal Area Router
- Routers which have all their OSPF interfaces in a normal area are normal internal routers
- These Routers will maintain a full LSDB of other routers and links in their own area
- They learn Inter Area Routers to other areas from their ABRs

## OSPF Router Types - ASBRs
- Routers which resdistribute into OSPF are Autonomous System Boundary Routers
- ASBRs means that it is running OSPF, but it is also running another routing protocol.
- Basically importing external routes and redistributing them into our OSPF network
- ASBRs will show up as External routes
  - But not as external traffic but as redistributed traffic

# Badnwidth vs Clock Rate and Speed

## The _Speed_ Command

- The rate that ethernet interfaces physically transmit at is set by the _Speed_ command
- GigabitEthernet interfaces transmit at 1000 Mbps by default
- FastEthernet Interfaces transmit at 100 Mbps by default
- If you use the _Speed 10_ command on a FastEthernet interface it will physically transmit at 10 Mbps

## The _Clock Rate_ Command

- The rate that **Serial** interfaces physically transmit at is set by the _clock rate_ command
- Serial interfaces transmit at 1.544 Mbps by default
- _Clock rate 64000_ command on a serial interface it will physically transmit at 64 Kbps

## The _Bandwidth_ Command

- Interfaces also have a default bandwidth
  - 100 Mbps on FastEthernet
- The bandwidth usually mathces the physical transmission rate of the interface
- The _bandwidth_ setting on an interface does not affect the physical transmission rate - that is set by the _speed_ or _clock rate_
- If you set a bandwidth of 50 Mbps on a FastEthernet interface, it will still transmit at 100Mbps
- The _bandwidth_ command affects software policy on the router, such as which path will be selected by EIGRP or OSPF, or how much bandwidth will be guaranteed to a traffic type by QoS
- You can influence software policy by setting the bandwidth on an interface

# OSPF Cost Metric

- As OSPF is a link state routing protocol, the router will elarn about all destinations in its area, the links and their cost
- The router will select routes based on its lowest cost to get to the destination
- In a multiple area OSPF network, ABRs know the information for each area they are connected to
- When multiple areas are in use, each router has individual routes for each IP subnet in its own aream and sumnmary routes to other areas which go via an ABR

## OSPF Metric Calculation
- For destinations in itws own area, a router looks at all available links to get there, and chooses the path with the lowest overall cost
- For destination in another area, a router looks at all available links to get to the ABR and chooses the path with the lowest overall cost to the ABR. It's then up to the ABR to choose the best path onwards from there.

## SPF Shortest Path First Alogrithm
- The SPF shortest Path First Alogrithm calculates the overall cost for each available path to each destination network, and then selects the lowest cost path
- The overall cost = cumulative cose of all outgoing interfaces
- You should ensure the cost is set the same on the interfaces on both sides of a link or you can get asymmetric routing
- SPF calculates the path on the outgoing interfaces and not the incoming interfaces. Which ever way traffic is being sent is the way it will calculate the cost
- We want to try to have the traffic travel the same path as it is delivered and received

## Reference Bandwidth
- The cost is automatically derived from the interface bandwidth
- Cost = Reference Bandwidth/Interface Bandwidth *divided by
- The default refence bandwidth is 100 Mbps
- FastEthernet link cost default to 1 (100/100)
- 100/1.544 = 64
- OSPF trreats all itnerfaces of 100 Mbps or faster as equal
- FastEthernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet all default to a cost of 1
  - This can cause undesirable routing in modern networks
- We can force a change in the cost by changing the reference bandwidth
- We want to change the reference bandwidth to a higher number because of the Cost formula up above
- The commands are
  - _Router OSPF 1_
  - _auto-cost reference-bandwidth 100000_

## Manipulating the OSPF Metric

- OSPF takes the bandwidth of an interface into account when calculating the metric, so paths along higher bandwidth links will be preferred
- The most desirable path will typically be automatically selected
- If you want to use a different path, you can manipulate this by manually changing the bandwidth or OSPF cost on interfaces
- It is recommended to use cost because the bandwidth setting can affect many features other than OSPF
- In interface configuration _ip ospf cost x_

# OSPF Adjacencies

## OSPF Operations Recap
1. Discover Neighbors
2. Form Adjacencies
3. Flood Link State Database
  - Create a link state database, meaning it will contain all the networks which it learned by OSPF
4. Compute Shortest Path
5. Install Best Routes in Routing Table
6. Respond to Network Changes


## OSPF Packet Types

- Sending out hello packets.
  - A router will send out and listen for hellow packets when OSPF is enabled on an interface, and form adjacencies with the other OSPF routers on the link
- Database Description (DBD)
  - Adjacent routers will tell each other the networks they know about with the DBD packet
- Link State Request
  - If a router is missing information about any of the networks in the received DBD, it will send the neighbor an LSR
- LSA Link State Advertisement
  - A routing update
- LSU Link State Update
  - Contains a list of LSA's which should be updated, used during flooding
- LSAck
  - Receiving routers acknowledge LSAs
 
### OSPF Protocol
Layer 3 Protocol with a protocol number of 89.

## OSPF Packet
<img width="707" height="173" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53e5da95-8a0a-45f3-8532-999c511a99b0" />

- Version: OSPFv2 or V3
- Type: The types described up above
- Router ID and Area ID: Of the **advertising** router and interface
- Authentication Type: 0- No password, 1- Plain-text password, 2- MD5 authentication


## Hello Packets

- Hello packets are how OSPF routers discover each other and form adjacencies
- Hello packets are sent out each interface where OSPF is enabled, except for passive interfaces
- 224.0.0.5 is the Multicast address for OSPF routers, which is sent out every 10 seconds

### Hello Packet Contents
- Router ID: A 32 bit number that uniquel identifies each OSPF router
- Hello Interval: How often a router sends a hello packet, 10 seconds by default
- Dead Interfacl: How long a router waits to hear from a neighbor before delcaring it out of service, if the router doesn't respond within 4 Hello Intervals it is considered dead
- Neighbors: A list of adjacent OSPF routers that this router has received a Hello Packet from
- Area ID: The area configured for that interface
- Router Priority: An 8 bit number used to select Designated Router (DR) and Backup Designated Router (BDR)
- DR and BDR IPv4 Address: If known. The IPv4 address will be included if known
- Authentication Flag: Authentication details if configured. If passwords are setup on your router, which they should be.
- Stub Area Flag: If the area is a stub area. Stub areas have a default router to their ABR rather than learning routes outside the area

- These settings must match for a pair of OSPF routers to form an adjacency with each other:
  - Must be in each other's neighbor list
  - Hello and Dead Intervals
  - Area ID
  - IP Subnet
  - Authentication Flag
  - Stub Area Flag
 
## MTU Mistmatches

If there is an MTU setting mismatch then OSPF rotuers can become beighbors but they will not exchange routers with each other
- MTU is configured at the interface level of a default of 1500 byters
- You can set interface MTU. which affects all packets, and/or interface IP MTU, which will only affect IP packets.
- While in interface configuration _MTU 1480_ or _IP MTU 1460_

## Neighbor States

Neighbor States
1. Down: No active neighbor detected
2. Initialize: Hello packet is received from the neighbor
3. 2-way: Own router ID in received hello
4. Exstart: Primary and secondary roles determined
5. Exchanged: Database description packets sent
6. Loading: Exchange of LSRs and LSUs
7. Full: Neighbors fully adjacent

# OSPF DR and BDR Designate Routers

## OSPF on Multiaccess Segments
- On point to point links, OSPF routers pairs form a FULL adjacency
- On multiaccess segments, such as ethernet, where there can be multiple routers, it is inefficient for all routers to form a FULL OSPF adjacency with each other
- In the example below we have 4 routers connected to a switch all on the same subnet. Since we have OSPF configured on all 4 routers, the hello packets that are sent out every 10 seconds would be inefficient. So a better idea would have 1 router become a "Master" and the other routers will be on standby. The "Master" is also named the Designated Router (DR).
- In order to form some redundancy, we will also have a Backup Designated Router (BDR).

<img width="439" height="220" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38817a9b-2605-4b43-a50c-be7435694887" />

## Designated Router and Backup Designated Router
- DRs and BDRs act on the interface level and not the router level, because if there are other interfaces that are connected to another ethernet segment, then the router wouldn't be the DR for that other ethernet segment
- DRs and BDRs are elected, meaning the router with highest priority becomes the DR and the second highest becomes the BDR
- Default priority is 1, the higher the better 0-255
- Highest router ID is used in case of a tie

## Neighbor States

### 2-way

- On multiaccess segments such as Ethernet, the routers elect the DR and BDR at the 2-way stage
- There is no eleciton on point to point links

## Setting OSPF Priority
- In interface config _ip ospf priority 100_
- Then restart OSPF on interface by rebooting the router, shutting down the interface, or _clear ip ospf_

## Multiaccess Segment NEighbor States
- The DR and BDR establish a FULL neighbor state with all routers on the network segment
- The neighbor state of other neighbors remains in a 2-way and they do not directly exchange routes with each other.
- In our topology above, R1(DR) and R2(BDR) are in a constant FULL state with all routers. R3 and R4 are in a FULL state with R1 and R2, but R3 and R4 will be in a 2-way state with each other
