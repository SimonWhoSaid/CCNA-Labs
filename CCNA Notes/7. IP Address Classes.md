# IP Address Classes

## Public IP Addresses

Public IP Addresses are mainly used by the ISP/Internet

Class A: 1.0.0.0 - 126.0.0.0/8
  - Large Networks

Class B: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0/16
  - Medium Networks

Class C: 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.0/24
  - Small Networks

## Private IP Addresses

Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255

Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255

Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

## IP Address Classes D & E

Class D: 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255
  - Class D is used for Multicast Addresses
  - Multicast allows to send 1 stream of data instead of multiple streams of data and only devices that belong to that specific multicast group will receive the info.

Class E: 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255
  - Experimental and reserved for future use

One thing to keep in mind is that routers never forward broadcast traffic.
Broadcast traffic is only sent out in the same subnet
