# OSI Model

## Layer1 - Physical

  - Deals with bits and ethernet cables
  - The physical link enables bit transmission between end devices
  - It defines specifications needed for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link between end devices.
  
## 2 - Data-link
  - Ethernet Frames
  - MAC addresses
  - The data link layer defines how data is formatted for transmission and how access to physical media is controlled
  - Also includes error detection and correction to ensure a reliable delivery of the data

## 3 - Network
  - Routing Packets
  - IP Address
  - Network layer provides connectivity and path selection between two host systems that may be located on geographically separated networks
  - The layer that manages the connectivity of hosts by providing logical addressing
  
## 4 - Transport
  - TCP/UDP
  - Ports
  - Deals with protocols on how data is transferred
  - Transport layer defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data for individual communications between the end devices
  - It breaks down large files into smaller segments that are less likely to incur transmission problems

## 5 - Session
  - The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between two communicating hosts.
  - The session layer also synchronizes dialog between the presentation layers of the two hosts and manages their data exhange

## 6 - Presentation
  - Ensures that information that is sent at the application layer of one system is readable by the application by the application layer of another system.
  - The presentation layer can translate among multiple data formats using a common format
  - Computers with different encoding schemes

## 7 - Application
  - Provides network services to the applications of the end user
  - Does not provide services to any other OSI layer
  - Establishes the availability of intended communication partners
  - It then synchronizes and establishes agreement on procedures for error recovery and control of data integrity

# TCP/IP
Only uses 4 layers

## 1 - Link
  - Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network
  
## 2 - Internet
  - Provides logical addressing and determines the best path through the network
  
## 3 - Transport
  - Supports communication between end devices across a diverse network

## 4 - Application
  - Represents data users, encodes and controls the dialog
  - Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
  - When two hosts talk to each other theyâ€™re going to be exchanging PDUs
  - The PDU is the entire communication of Layer 7 to Layer 1
  - In the TCP/IP Stack Layer 4 is the data
  - Layer 3 PDU - Segments
  - Layer 2 PDU - Packet
  - Layer 1 PDU - Frames
