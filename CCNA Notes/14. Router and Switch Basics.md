# Basic Router and Switch Configuration

We will be learning about basic configurations to put on our routers and switches

## Router Configuration

A Router provides connectivity between different IP subnets.
So Routers interfaces must be configued with IP addresses within that subnet. That interface will act as the default gateway for that subnet

To put an IP address on an interface we must first go to that interface in the command line

We will enter the interface

- interface F0/0 (from config t)

Then we enter the IP address and subnet mask

- 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0

Then we enter the no shutdown command to bring the interface online. Interfaces are shutdown by default

- no shutdown

Next we must also configure another interface so that it can talk to another subnet.

- interface F0/1
- 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
- no shutdown

Now our two networks, 192.168.0.0 network and 192.168.1.0 network, can now communicate with each other.

## Switch Configuration

A layer 2 switch is not IP routing aware, but it does support a single IP address for management.
The IP address and subnet mask is configured on the Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) for the default VLAN 1.
A default gateway also needs to be configured to allow connectivity to other subnets

Because we need to configure the VLAN on the switch instead of pointing to a specific interface, we will be pointing to our VLAN that it belongs to

- interface vlan 1 (from config t)
- ip address 192.168.0.10 255.255.255.0
- no shutdown
- exit
- (config) # ip default-gateway 192.168.0.1

So in this example we basically followed the same steps for the router config, but at the end we have to assign a default gateway for our switch to forward traffic to a different subnet.


### Hostname configuration

In config t just type in the command _hostname_ followed by the hostname you want to give the device
- Hostname R1
- Hostname Switch 1

### Interface Descriptions

We will configure interface descriptions to see where the interface points to. We will enter the interface we want to add the description, then we will add the _description_ command followed by the description of what we want.

- interface f0/1
- description Link to R1
- show interfaces description OR show running-config interface f0/1

  ### Saving Changes

  To save our changes for our devices, we will enter the command _copy running-config startup-config_
  What we are essentially doing is copying the running-config (our current configuration that is stored in RAM, volatile memory) to our startup configuration (our configuration when we reboot, saved in NVRAM)
