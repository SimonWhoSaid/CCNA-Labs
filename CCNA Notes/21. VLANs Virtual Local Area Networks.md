# Campus LAN Design - Core, Distribution, and Access Layers

- The campus LAN should be designed for scalability, performance, and security
- To aid in a best practice design process, the network topology is split into **Access, Distribution, and Core layers**

### Access Layer
- This is where the end host plugs into. Usually into "Access Switches".
- The access layer is designed to have a high port count at an affordable cost.
- Desktops typically have only one NIC so they connect into one switch or WAP
- Servers will often have dual NICs and connect to a a pair of redundant switches
- Client access security measures are enabled at the access layer
