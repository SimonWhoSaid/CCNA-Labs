## CIDR Notation

Classless Inter-Domain Routing.

CIDR Notation is responible for removing the fixed classes and helped create subnets
  - So instead of /8 /16 /24 networks we are able to create something like a /20 subnet

CIDR and Route Sumarization

  - Aggregates blocks of networks on the internet. If a network has 4 contiguous /24 subnets 10.10.1.0, 10.10.2.0, 10.10.3.0 10.10.4.0, these can be summarized into a single /22 block. This provides one route to cover all four networks
  - Helps reduce routing table size which improves router perfromance
  - Enhances network scalability

## Subnetting Overview

Subnetting helps create smaller networks in one network.

  - When subnetting we always go further into the right
      - /24 -> /28
  - Hosts on different subnets need to go through a router to communicate

## Subnetting Class C and Variable Length Subnet Mask

For an example lets take the IP address of 200.15.10.0/31
  - /31 breaks the standrad rules of IP Addressing
  - /31 subnets are supported on Cisco routers for point-to-point links
  - Point-to-point links have no need for a network or broadcast address

Variable Length Subnet Masks

VLSM allows us to size subnets differently according to how many hosts they have.

## Calculating Hosts Per Network

What I like to do is get the borrowed bits and substract by 2. We subtract by 2 because we have to reserve space for the network and broadcast address.

Class C Networks

/25 = 128-2 = 126 possible hosts
/26 = 64-2 = 62 possible hosts
/27 = 32-2 = 30 possible hosts
/28 = 16-2 = 14 possible hosts
/29 = 8-2 = 6 possible hosts
/30 = 4-2 = 2 possible hosts


## Private IP Address

- RFC 1918 specifies private IP addresses that are not routable
- Private IP Addresses were originally designed not to connect to the internet

Class A Private Addresses

- 10.0.0.0/8

Class B Private Addresses

  - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255

Class C Private Addresses

  - 192.168.0.0/16

NAT was implemented as a work around to mitigate the lack of IPv4 addresses

Another thing to note is that IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long.
