At layer 2 of the OSI model we will be dealing with frames and ethernet protocols.

Preamble is 8 bytes in length, Destination Address is 6 bytes, Source Address 6 bytes, "Ethertype" is 2 bytes, Data can at minimum 46 bytes and MTU at 1500, then the Frame Check Sequence at 4 bytes

Preamble

- A sequence of alternating 1s and 0s at the beginning of the frame that helps synchronize the receiving device's clock with the incoming data

Destination and Source MAC address

- Destination specifying the MAC address of the device to which the frame is being sent
- Source indicates the MAC address of the device sending the frame

Ethertype

- A 2 byte field specifying either the type of protocol in the payload (ethertype) or the length of the payload

Payload/Data

- Payload refers to the actauly data being transmitted. It can vary in size between 46-1500 bytes in length

Frame Check Sequence

- A 4-byte field for error checking, it helps the receiving device identify any errors in the frame during transmission

MAC addresses are 48 bit hexadecimal

The first 26 bits in a MAC address are the organizer unique identifier. The second half is vendor assigned.

AA:BB:CC:11:22:33

The first half (A-C) represents the organization then the later half (1-3) represent the vendor assigned address.
