# The Boot Up Process

## Cisco Device Memory

Cisco routers and switches have 4 built-in memory locations:
- ROM - Read Only Memory
  - When the device is powered on, it will first load from ROM
  - Two main functions are performed
    1. Power On Self Test
    2. Load Bootstrap
  - The botostrap will look in flash for an IOS software image to load
  - If an IOS iamge cannot be found the device will show the ROMMON prompt at the command line
  - ROMMON or ROM Monitor can be used to recover a missing or corrupted software image
  - In this case you can boot from USB or an external TFTP server to recover the device
  - You can also search for ROMMON Recovery for your specific device model, you can find the instructions here.
- Flash - Removable CompactFlash
  - The system will load the first IOS image found in Flash by default
  - You can override this with the _Boot System_ command, to get to a new image
  - You can copy additional IOS system images to Flash via TFTP or USB
  - Use the _Show Flash_ command to view the system image
  - To delete the system image _Delete Flash:"System Image File"_
- NVRAM - Non-Volatile Random Access Memory
  - When the system has finished loading the IOS system image from Flash, it will load the "startup-config" configuration file from NVRAM
  - The saved startup-config becomes the current running-config in RAM
  - If no startup-config file is found, the device will load the Setup Wizard
  - Whenever you enter a command in IOS it takes effect immediately and goes into the "running-config" which is stored in RAM
  - To make change permanent across a reboot:
    - _Copy Running-Config Startup-Config_
- RAM - Random Access Memory
  - The IOS system image and startup-config are loaded from Flash and NVRAM into RAM during the bootup
  - RAM is used as the normal working memory of the device
  - ROM, Flash, NVRAM are permanent memory, their contents are not lost when the device is powered off or rebooted
  - RAM is volatile memory, meaning its contents are lost when the deivce is powered off


## Small Considerations

### VLAN Database
The VLAN database represented by vlan.dat, is saved in either Flash or NVRAM. This is dependent on the model of the switch

### Booting from TFTP

The system can also load a system image and/or startup-config from an external TFTP server instead of Flash/NVRAM, but generally this is not recommended because the device will nto be able to boot if it loses connectivity to the server.
It is usually used where the device does not have enough capacity in Flash to save the system image
