# Hubs, Switches, and Routers

Hubs and switches perform a similar function

## Hubs

- Hubs alway operate in half-duplex mode
- Hubs are considered a layer 1 device
- Half duplex cannot send and receive information at the same time
- All hosts share the same collision domain, this means that only one host can transmit at a time
- CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Accss with Collision Detection) is used to detect collisions. When a collision is detected, devices send a jamming signal, stop transmitting, and then wait a random amount of time before attempting to retransmit to avoid another immediate collision

## Switches

- While switches can operate in both half or full duplex mode
- Switches are also a layer 2 device (sometimes layer 3)

 ## Routers

 - Routers know the paths to get to different IP subnets on a network.
 - Routers route traffic between different networks, while switches switch traffic between hosts on a LAN
 - Routers do no forward broadcast traffic

## Layer 3 Switches

- Layer 3 switches are able to route to different subnets on the same LAN.
- They can not route to a WAN

## Other Cisco Devices

 - Firewalls
 - IPS
 - LAN controllers - Manage WAP and wireless network
 - WAP - Wireless Access Point
