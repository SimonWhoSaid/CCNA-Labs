## Dynamic Routing Protocols

- When a routing protocol is used, routers automatically advertise their best paths to known networks to each other
- After the router has automatically advertise itself, and it learns the routes that were advertise from the other router
  - "You can get to these networks through me"
- Routers use this infomration to determine their own best path to the known destinations
- When the state of the network changes, such as a link going down or a new subnet being added, the routers update each other
- Routers will automatically calculate a new best path and update the routing table if the network changes

## Dynamic Summary Routes

- Summary routes lead to less memory usage in routers
- They also lead to less CPU usage as changes in the network only affect other routers in the same area
  - For Example, if the link on R1 to the the 10.0.1.1/24 network goes down, R2 will lose its route there and try to compute a new path
  - R3 will not be affected as its summary route to 10.0.0.0/16 is unchanged
 
## Dynamic Routing Protocols Advantages

- Routing protocols are more scalable than administrator defined static routes
- In dynamic routing, routers automatically advertise available sunbnets to each other without the administrator having to manually enter every route on every router
- If a subnet is added or remvoed the routers will automatically discover that and update their routing tables
- If the best path to a subnet goes down routers automatically discover that and will calculate a new best path if one is available.
- The routers automatically advertise available subnets to each other without the admin having to m anually enter every route on every router
- If a subnet is added or removed the routers will automatically discover that and update their routing tables.
- If the best path to a subnet goes down routers automatically discover that and will calculate a new best path if one is available
- Using a combination of dynamic routing protocol and static routes is very common in real world environments
- In this case the routing protocol will be used to carry the bulk of the network information
- Static routes can also be used on an as needed basis, for example backup purposes or for a static route to the internet

# Routing Protocols Types

- Routing protocols can be split into two main types:
  - Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP)
  - Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)
- Interior gateway protocols are used for routing with and organization
- Exterior gateway protocols are used for routing between organizations over the internet
  - The only EGP in use today is Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
 
- IGPs
  - Distance Vector Routing Protocols
    - Measures the distance by the number of routers a packet has to pass
    - Distance vector always looks for the shortest number of hops to take
    - In distance vector protocols, each router sends it directly connected neighbors a list of all its known networks along with its own distance to each of those networks
    - Distance vector routing protocols do not advertise the entire network topology
    - A router only knows its directly connected neighbors and the lists of networks those neighbors have advertised. It doesn't have detailed topology information beyond its directly connected neighbors
  - Link State Routing Protocols
    - Link State Routing Protocols considers multiple routes with the best speeds
    - With this protocol each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbors
    - This information is passed unchanged from one route to another
    - Every router learns the full picture of the network including every router, its interfaces, and what they connect to.
