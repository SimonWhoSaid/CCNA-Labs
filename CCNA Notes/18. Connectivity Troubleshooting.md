# Basic Connectivity Troubleshooting

## Ping
Ping uses ICMP, Internet Control message Protocol.

Ping is used to test out 2 way connectivity. It is broken down like this:

R1 will send out a ICMP Echo Request with its Source IP and the Destination IP.

Then the Destination IP will send a ICMP Echo Reply with its Source IP back to the original IP of R1.

Somethings to take note of while using the Ping command in Cisco ios:
- !!!!! - Exclamation marks means that the ping was able to reach its destination
- ..... - Periods means the ping was not able to reach its destination
- UUUUU - Means that the router discarded the packet for whatever reason

## Extended Ping

When you ping an IP address from a router it will use its interface that is connected to the destination IP address as the source address. This means that devices in a different subnet on the router, if they don't know the path, will not be able to reach its destination.
But when we do an extended ping we can specify which interface to ping out of, so that the subnet can be discovered. This helps with reachability from different subnets.

You can do extended ping by just entering _ping_ by itself. This will put you into a wizard which you can follow the instructions.

## Traceroute

Very similiar to ping and helps test connectivity. Traceroute helps show how many hops it takes to get to the destination and shows the TTL.
A router will add as many TTLs as it takes to reach its destination.

For example if there were 10 routers to reach a destination IP address, it will send out 1 TTL for the first hop, then after it gets a reply, it will send out 2 TTLs, 2 for the 2 hops it takes, then 3 and so on until it reaches its destination.
