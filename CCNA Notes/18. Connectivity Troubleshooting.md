# Basic Connectivity Troubleshooting

## Ping
Ping uses ICMP, Internet Control message Protocol.

Ping is used to test out 2 way connectivity. It is broken down like this:

R1 will send out a ICMP Echo Request with its Source IP and the Destination IP.

Then the Destination IP will send a ICMP Echo Reply with its Source IP back to the original IP of R1.

Somethings to take note of while using the Ping command in Cisco ios:
- !!!!! - Exclamation marks means that the ping was able to reach its destination
- ..... - Periods means the ping was not able to reach its destination
- UUUUU - Means that the router discarded the packet for whatever reason
