# Connected and Local Routes

## Router Functions

A Router has 2 main functions:
  - Determining the best path to available networks
  - Forwarding traffic to those network

### The Routing Table

The best available path or paths to a destination network are listed in a router's routing table and will be used for forwarding traffic. A routing table consists of directly connected networks and routes configured statically by the administrator or dynamically learned through a routing protocol.

To view the routing table use the command _show ip route_

### Connected and Local Routes

When the administrator configures IP addresses on the router's interfaces it will automatically enter connected routes into the routing table

**Connected Routes**

Because we configured those IP addresses on those interfaces the router already knows that it is connected to those networks.

In the photos above the router already knows to reach the 10.0.0.0/24 network by sending out information to interface F0/0 because of how we manually configured it.

**Local Routes**

Local routes always have a /32 mask and show the IP address configured on the interface

So instead of showing the network, like on connected routes, it will instead show the IP address of the interface. This helps with administrating the router.

# Static Routes

If a router receives traffic for a network which it is not directly attached to, it needs to know how to get there in order to forward the traffic. An administrator can manually add a static route to the destiantion, or the router can learn it dynamically via a routing protocol.

The command to add a static route is _Ip Route_

The syntax is _Ip Route (IP subnet you want to reach) (subnet mask) (The Next Hop IP Address you need to send the packet out of)_

 - IP Route 10.1.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2

IF you are assigning routes statically you must assign all routers to reach those subnets with _IP Route_
