# Basic Router and Switch Configuration

We will be learning about basic configurations to put on our routers and switches

## Router Configuration

A Router provides connectivity between different IP subnets.
So Routers interfaces must be configued with IP addresses within that subnet. That interface will act as the default gateway for that subnet

To put an IP address on an interface we must first go to that interface in the command line

We will enter the interface

- interface F0/0 (from config t)

Then we enter the IP address and subnet mask

- 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0

Then we enter the no shutdown command to bring the interface online. Interfaces are shutdown by default

- no shutdown

Next we must also configure another interface so that it can talk to another subnet.

- interface F0/1
- 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
- no shutdown

Now our two networks, 192.168.0.0 network and 192.168.1.0 network, can not communicate with each other.
