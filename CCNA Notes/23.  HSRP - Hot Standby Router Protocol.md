# Network Redundancy

The point of redundancy is to eliminate single points of failure. We can still reach the internet if any core/distribution layer switch, router, or links fail.

We will be using this diagram as an example for our configurations

Configure the first static route, this will be for R1
- (config)#_ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.1_

Configure the backup default static route with a higher admin distance, this one will go to R2
-(config)#_ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.20.2 5_

Then configure a backup link for g0/1, just in case the route to the end users go down.
- (config)#_ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.2_

# First Hop Redundancy Protocols - FHRP

First Hop Redundancy Protocols use a Virtual IP and MAC address to allow for automated gateway failover. The hosts use the VIP as their default gateway address. If a physical gateway fails, another gateway will take over.
With our diagram above we will be adding the Virtual IP to R1 and R2. The VIP will be 10.10.10.1. 

The default gateway for the PCs will be pointed at the VIP, then if R1 were to fail, R2 will detect that R1 is down and will automatically use the VIP of R1. So now R2 will become the default gateway but the VIP will be the same.

- Gateway Load Balancing Protocol: Cisco proprietary, supports active/active load balancing across multiple routers

# Hot Standby Router Protocol - HSRP

HSRP uses a VIP and MAC address to allow for automated gateway failover. The hosts use the VIP as their default gateway address and if the active gatewat fails, the standby gateway will take over.

## HSRP Operations

Both routers have a normal physical IP address and MAC address on their HSRP interface. Unique addresses are used on both routers. They both also have teh HSRP VIP and MAC address configured on the interface, the same addresses are used on both routers.

When they come online, one is elected the HSRP **active** router, the other is in **standby**. The active router owns the VIP and MAC and responds to ARP requests. All traffic for the VIP goes through the active router.

HSRP uses hello packets to message the other router to let them know that it is still active. If the standby router does not receive a hello packet then it will transition to become the active router.

## HSRP Configuration

To enable HSRP you will be using the _standby_ command. The higher the IP address will indicate which Router will become the active router and the other will be the standby.

R1 configuration
- (config)#_interface g0/1_
- (config-if)#_IP address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0_
- (config-if)#_no shutdown_
- (config-if)#_standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1_

R2 configuration
- (config)#_interface g0/1_
- (config-if)#_ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0_
- (config-if)#_no shutdown_
- (config-if)#_standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1_

Verification
- R1#_show standby_
