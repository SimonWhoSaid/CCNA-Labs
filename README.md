# CCNA-Labs
I created this repository as a walkthrough for [Neil Anderson's](https://www.udemy.com/course/ccna-complete/) and Ross Bagurdes' CCNA labs and for note taking as well. These labs will be performed with [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/articles/news/download-cisco-packet-tracer) I will be documenting my steps and procedures for each lab and explain the desired outcome.
